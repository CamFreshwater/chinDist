Study system
* Chinook salmon are harvested in a mix of commercial, recreational, and First Nations fisheries, prior to and during their return migrations to freshwater
  + In southern BC the specific timing and location of these fisheries changes annually due to fishery management decisions
  +	Recently, however, the commercial fishery operates in early summer and fall, with monthly quotas. Restricted to WCVI since mid-90s
  +	The recreational fishery operates year-round, although effort peaks in summer months and retention is restricted in specific areas due to closures
*	These regions are seasonally occupied by populations originating from northern British Columbia to central California
  +	We focused our analysis on populations aggregated at two ecological scalesâ€”regional aggregates as defined in Pacific Salmon Treaty documents and finer scale stock aggregates specifically relevant to Canadian management (table)
  +	Each stock grouping contains a mix of hatchery- and wild-origin populations; however, the relative proportion of each is highly variable

GSI data collection
*	GSI data were collected from 2007-2015 dockside and at processing facilities
  + Sampling was performed by observers under contract to DFO's Mark Recovery Program (MRP), who are responsible for recovering CWTs in commercial fisheries
  + The MRP program aims to sample 20% of the landed catch for CWTs; these individuals were further sub-sampled to provide GSI samples with a target of 4% of the catch and a minimum of 200 (July-March) or 500 (April-June) samples per catch region and month (barring very small catches)
* In 2008-2011 additional at-sea sampling occurred during May, June and Sep in SA 123 (keep or ditch this?)
*	GSI samples could generally be attributed to a statistical area and landing day (Figure 1)
*	Commercial catch and effort data were retrieved from the FOS database, which contains daily counts of adult Chinook retained in each day and fishery statistical area as recorded in mandatory vessel logbooks.
  +	Effort = boat days
  +	We paired genetics and abundance data by focusing our analyses at the weekly time scale; given most troller trips are 3-4 days in length we assigned samples to the previous statistical week if they were landed on or before Tuesday and the current stat week otherwise
  
Genetic stock identification
*	Individual stock assignment probabilities were determined using microsatellites and the coastwide baseline (Beacham et al. 2006)
*	We excluded all individuals with a <75% probability of assignment to a given stock (~15%) of samples
*	We aggregated individual stocks based on groupings described in DFO and PST documents 

CWT data collection
* We extracted recoveries of CWT release groups from the RMIS database
  + We restricted our analysis to equivalent fisheries (i.e. ocean or test fishery troll; fishery codes, 10-15 and 60)
* CWTs are recovered by contractors at landing sites; 
* We used the unadjusted number of recovered tags, rather than the expanded number that accounts for sampling effort, because an equivalent adjustment is not performed for the GSI samples
  + Expansion factors also quite low (mean 3.5, sd 1.14)
* We assigned release groups to equivalent stock groups as the GSI data based on hatchery location and life history type


Stock-specific catch and distribution model
* We assumed catch rate could be used as a proxy for abundance in a given spatio-temporal strata

We modeled total catch as a negative binomial process, with mean $mu$ and dispersion $k$, via a link function and the following linear predictor:

$$log(\mu_{my}) = \alpha_m + \alpha_y + {\alpha_{b1}}b_{m} + {\alpha_{b2}b_{m}^2} $$

where $$\alpha_m$$ is the intercept for strata $m$ (i.e. a unique combination of month and catch region), $$\alpha_y$$ is the intercept for year $y$, and $\alpha_{b1}$ and $\alpha_{b2}$ describe linear and exponential effects associated with strata-specific effort ($b$; boat days). 

We modeled stock composition as a multinomial process where $\pi_{g}$ represents the probability of encountering stock group $g$ among $G$ total stock groups. We estimated changes in stock composition across strata by modeling the log odds of encountering $g$ relative to the reference stock group $g'$ (the last value in the vector $\mathbf{g}$ of stock groups)

$$ log(\frac{\pi^{(g)}_{my}}{\pi^{(g')}_{my}}) = \beta_m + \beta_y $$

where $\beta_m$ and $\beta_y$ are strata- and year-specific intercepts. Thus encounter probabilities can be calculated for each non-reference stock group as 

$$\pi^{(g)}_{my} = \frac{e^{\beta^{(g)}_m + \beta^{(g)}_y}} {1 + \sum^{g'-1}_{k=1} e^{\beta^{(k)}_m + \beta^{(k)}_y}}$$
and for the reference stock group as 

$$ \pi^{(g')}_{my} = 1 - \sum_{k=1}^{g'-1} \pi^{(k)}_{my}.$$


To account for interannual differences in spatio-temporal fishery closures we modeled $\alpha_y$ and $\beta_y$ as random variables from the following hyperdistributions:

$$ \alpha_y \sim \text{normal}(\nu_{\alpha_y}, \sigma^2_{\alpha_y}) $$
$$ \beta_y \sim \text{normal}(\nu_{\beta_y}, \sigma^2_{\beta_y}). $$

The two model components allowed us to predict the probability of encountering a given stock group in an "average" year by integrating across random effects. Similarly we generated predictions of stock-specific abundance by multiplying predicted aggregate catch by the probability of encountering a given stock.
