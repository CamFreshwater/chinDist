Study system
* Chinook salmon are harvested in a mix of commercial, recreational, and First Nations fisheries, prior to and during their return migrations to freshwater
  + In southern BC the specific timing and location of these fisheries changes annually due to fishery management decisions
  +	Recently, however, the commercial fishery operates in early summer and fall, with monthly quotas. Restricted to WCVI since mid-90s
  +	The recreational fishery operates year-round, although effort peaks in summer months and retention is restricted in specific areas due to closures
*	These regions are seasonally occupied by populations originating from northern British Columbia to central California
  +	We focused our analysis on populations aggregated at two ecological scalesâ€”regional aggregates as defined in Pacific Salmon Treaty documents and finer scale stock aggregates specifically relevant to Canadian management (table)
  +	Each stock grouping contains a mix of hatchery- and wild-origin populations; however, the relative proportion of each is highly variable

Data collection and genotyping
*	GSI data were collected from 2007-2015 by a mix of at-sea and dockside observers
  +	On-board observers sampled the first 25-50 fish landed daily; additional 25-50 sampled if the vessel changed PFMAs
  +	Dockside sampling was associated with the mark recovery program which samples commercial catch for CWT recoveries.
  +	~4% of the month- and PFMA-specific catch was sampled 
  +	GSI samples could be attributed to a statistical area and landing day
*	Commercial catch and effort data were retrieved from the FOS database, which contains daily counts of adult Chinook retained in each day and fishery statistical area as recorded in mandatory vessel logbooks.
  +	Effort = boat days
  +	We paired genetics and abundance data by focusing our analyses at the weekly time scale (trollers are typically at-sea for 3-4 days (pers. comm.))
Genetic stock identification
*	Individual stock assignment probabilities were determined using microsatellites (Beacham et al. 2006)
*	We excluded all individuals with a <75% probability of assignment to a given stock (~15%) of samples
*	We aggregated individual stocks based on groupings described in DFO and PST documents 

Stock-specific catch and distribution model
* We assumed catch rate could be used as a proxy for abundance in a given spatio-temporal strata

We modeled catch as a negative binomial process with mean $mu$

$$log(\mu_{lmy}) = \alpha_{lm} + {\beta_1}b_{lm} + {\beta_2b_{lm}^2} + \gamma_y$$

where $$\alpha$$ is the intercept for catch region $l$ and month $m$, while $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ describe linear and exponential effects associated with strata-specific effort (boat days). $\gamma$ is a year-specific intercept that was modeled hierarchically 

$$ \gamma \sim \text{normal}(0, \sigma_{\gamma}) $$
