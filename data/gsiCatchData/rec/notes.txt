Notes on recreational catch/effort data

May 27, 2020
- Catch and effort downloaded from regional salmon drive (file = Biological_Data_With_Results (Apr23 2020) 2014 2019 GST JDF JST REN May13.xlsx)
- Catch and effort (boat trips) extracted from 'YTD-data' tab (presumably generated by Kris Hein and based on creel survey data)
- Exported to github repo as .csv
- Given that size distribution of kept and released individuals differed pretty strongly in GSI data, kept catch estimates separate
- For now retaining both published and unpublished estimates. Inquire with south coast
- Some strata are missing effort data. Inquire with south coast

To ask south coast:
1) How to deal w/ kept/released GSI and catch data
2) What to do with published vs. unpublished catch estimates
3) What to do about taak data
4) What to do about missing effort data
