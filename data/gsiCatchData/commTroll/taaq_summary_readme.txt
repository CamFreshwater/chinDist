taaq_summary_readme

Data originated from Lee Kearey and saved on CF local as taaq_fromLK_Jun12.xlsx

Strata (ie stat area-month-year) with large T'aaq contributions are identified and flagged for removal from specific analyses if 
commercial catch did not occur in the same region during that month/year.
These data can be included in estimates of composition (since T'aaq are fishing in similar areas), but should not be incorporated
into estimates of stock-specific abundance.
