OTHER				The species name, caught count and sampled count of other species (not included in specific columns) that were captured during the sampling event, using the recording format of "SPECIES_NAME CAUGHT_COUNT // SAMPLED_COUNT". May also contain comments regarding the set such as "NO CATCH 0//0" to indicate that the set was performed but that nothing was captured. The first record for a year also includes a note on when the database was last updated.
OTHER2				The count of other species (not included in specific columns) that were sampled (measured for length and possibly for sex and stomach contents) during the sampling event. (Duplicates some of the data from the OTHER column but was used to verify the expected count of fish length measurement records.)
COMMENTS			The explanatory notes associated with the sampling event as recorded on the field sheet.
